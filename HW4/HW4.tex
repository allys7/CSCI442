\question{Many current language specifications, such as for C and C++, are
    inadequate for multi-threaded programs. This can have an impact on
    compilers and the correctness of code, as this problem illustrates.
    Consider the following declarations and function definition:}

    \begin{verbatim}
    int global_positives = 0;
    typedef struct list {
        struct list *next;
        double val;
    } * list;

    void count_positives(list l) {
        list p;
        for (p = l; p; p = p -> next)
        if (p -> val > 0.0)
        ++global_positives;
    }
    \end{verbatim}

    Now consider the case in which threads A executes \texttt{count\_positives(<list
    containing only negative values>)} while thread B executes \texttt{++global\_
    positives}.

    \begin{alphaparts}
        \questionpart{What does the function do?}

        \questionpart{The C language only addresses single-threaded execution.
        Does the use of two parallel threads create any problems or potential
        problems?}
    \end{alphaparts}

    \clearpage
    \question{Some existing optimizing compilers (including gcc, which tends
    to be relatively conservative) will `optimize' count\_positives to something
    similar to the following:}

    \begin{verbatim}
        void count_positives(list l) { 
            list p; 
            register int r; 
            r = global_positives; 
            for (p = l; p; p = p -> next) 
                if (p -> val > 0.0) ++r; 
            global_positives = r; 
        }
    \end{verbatim}

    What problem or potential problems occurs with this compiled version of the
    program if threads A and B are executed concurrently?

    \clearpage
    \question{In the discussion of ULTs versus KLTs, it was pointed out that a
    disadvantage of ULTs is that when a ULT executes a system call, not only is
    that thread blocked, but also all of the threads within the process are
    blocked. Why is that so?}
    
    
    \clearpage
    \question{Consider an environment in which there is a one-to-one mapping
    between user-level threads and kernel-level threads that allows one or more
    threads within a process to issue blocking system calls while other threads
    continue to run. Explain why this model can make multi-threaded programs
    run faster than their single-threaded counterparts on a uni-processor
    computer.}
